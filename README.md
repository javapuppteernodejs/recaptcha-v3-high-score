## ü§ñ How to Solve reCaptcha v3 and Achieve a Human-like Score

### Requisites

- **CapSolver Key:** Your API key from CapSolver.
- **Proxy (Optional):** While optional, it's recommended to use your own proxy for reCaptcha v3 as IP quality is crucial for obtaining a high score.

### Important Considerations

- **`pageAction`:** Must be accurate. Refer to [this blog](https://www.capsolver.com/blog/how-to-identify-and-find-values-of-recaptchav3) for guidance on obtaining the correct `pageAction`.
- **`websiteURL`:** Must be correct.
- **Proxy Quality:** If using `ReCaptchaV3TaskProxyLess`, a proxy isn‚Äôt required, but if using `ReCaptchaV3Task`, a good proxy is essential. Poor proxy quality or incorrect `pageAction` and `websiteURL` can result in a low score, affecting the outcome.

### Task Types

- **`ReCaptchaV3Task`:** Requires your own proxies.
- **`ReCaptchaV3TaskProxyLess`:** Uses the server's built-in proxy.

For this example, we'll use **ReCaptchaV3TaskProxyLess** to test our token score using [this page](https://antcpt.com/score_detector).

### ‚ö° Step 1: Submit the Required Information to CapSolver

Send the following request to CapSolver to create a task:

```json
POST https://api.capsolver.com/createTask
{
  "clientKey":"yourapiKey",
  "task": {
    "type": "ReCaptchaV3TaskProxyLess",
    "websiteURL": "https://antcpt.com/score_detector",
    "websiteKey": "6LcR_okUAAAAAPYrPe-HK_0RULO1aZM15ENyM-Mf",
    "pageAction": "homepage"
  }
}
```

### ü™Ñ Step 2: Retrieve the Captcha Solution

Use the `getTaskResult` method to retrieve the solution:

```json
POST https://api.capsolver.com/getTaskResult
{
    "clientKey":"YOUR_API_KEY",
    "taskId": "TASKID_OF_CREATETASK"
}
```

Check every 3 to 5 seconds to see if the captcha has been solved.

### üìù Example: Submitting the Captcha Token to the Test Website

```js
var request = require('request');
var options = {
  method: 'POST',
  url: 'https://antcpt.com/score_detector/verify.php',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    "g-recaptcha-response": "here the token of capsolver"
  })
};

request(options, function (error, response) {
  if (error) throw new Error(error);
  console.log(response.body);
});
```

The test page will respond with the score of the token.

### Troubleshooting

If the token returns a low score or isn‚Äôt accepted, review the earlier points about ensuring correct parameters. If issues persist, refer to this [blog post](https://www.capsolver.com/blog/How-to-bypass-all-the-versions-reCAPTCHA-v2-v3) for additional guidance.
